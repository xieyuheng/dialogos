<title>Guidelines for The Reader</title>
Do not rush through this book.
Read carefully, including the frame notes;
valuable hints are scattered throughout the text.
Read every chapter.
Remember to take breaks so each chapter can sink in.
Read systematically.
If you do not fully understand one chapter,
you will understand the next one even less.
The questions are ordered by increasing difficulty;
later questions rely on comfort gained earlier in the book.

*Guess!* This book is based on intuition,
and yours is as good as anyone's.
Also, if you can, experiment with the examples while you read.

From time to time, we show computation steps in a chart.
Stop and work through each chart, even the long ones,
and convince yourself *that* each step makes sense
by understanding *why* it makes sense.

The **Laws** and **Commandments** summarize the meanings of expressions in Pie.
Laws describe which expressions are meaningful,
and Commandments describe which expressions are the same as others.
For a Commandment to apply, it is assumed that the corresponding Laws are satisfied.

- The "Laws describe which expressions are meaningful"
  is the first form of judgments.
  The "Commandments describe which expressions are the same as others"
  is the second form of judgments.

Food appears in some examples for two reasons.
First, food is easier to visualize than abstract symbols.
We hope the food imagery helps you to better understand the examples and concepts.
Second, we want to provide a little distraction.
Expanding your mind can be tiring;
these snacks should help you get through the afternoon.
As such, we hope that thinking about food will lead you to take some breaks and relax.

You are now ready to start.
Good luck! We hope you enjoy the book.

- The book is not as systematic as textbook,
  but you need to "read systematically",
  to organize the frames into your own system,
  "your intuition is as good as anyone's."
  - The lack of explicit system,
    helps the reader to read the frames actively.

- Learning in this way is viewed as "expanding your mind".

<title>1. The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same</title>

<dialog>
<question>
Welcome back!
</question>
<answer>
It's good to be here!
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Let's dust off and update some of our old toys
for a new language called Pie.

Is it obvious that this is an Atom?
  'atom
</question>
<answer>
Not at all. What does Atom mean?
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
To be an Atom is to be an atom.^[+]
<note name="+">
In Lisp, atoms are symbols, numbers, and many other things.
Here, atoms are only symbols.
</note>
</question>
<answer>
Then 'atom is an Atom because 'atom is an atom.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Is it obvious that this is an Atom?
  'ratatouille
</question>
<answer>
Yes, because 'ratatouille is also an atom.

But what does it precisely mean to be an atom?
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Atoms are built from a tick mark
directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens.^[+]
<note name="+">
In Pie, only atoms use the tick mark.
</note>
</question>
<answer>
So, is it obvious that
  'is-it-obvious-that-this-is-an-atom
is an Atom?
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Certainly, because atoms can contain hyphens.

What about
  '---
and
  ---
and
  '
Are they atoms?
</question>
<answer>
Hum...
  '---
is an atom because hyphens can appear anywhere in an atom;
  ---
is not an atom because it's missing the tick mark; and
  '
is not an atom because it is neither followed by a letter nor by a hyphen.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Is 'Atom an Atom?
</question>
<answer>
Yes, even 'Atom is an Atom, because it is a tick mark followed by one or more letters or hyphens.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Is 'atOm an Atom?
</question>
<answer>
No, because atoms can contain only letters and hyphens,
as mentioned in frame 5,
and the character 0 is not a letter.
It is the digit zero.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Is 'cœurs-d-artichauts an Atom?
</question>
<answer>
Yes, because œ is a letter.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Is 'ἄτομον an Atom?
</question>
<answer>
That's Greek to me!

But Greek letters are letters, so it must also be an Atom.
</answer>
</dialog>

<comment>
The aim of the above frames is to explain the following law.
</comment>

<card kind="law">
<title>The Law of Tick Marks</title>
A tick mark directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens is an Atom.
</card>

<comment topic="didactics">
<title>The Didactics of forwarding engaging examples</title>

To introduce a new concept, first give many engaging examples.
</comment>

<dialog>
<question>
Sentences such as
  'ratatouille is an Atom
and
  'cœurs-d-artichauts is an Atom
are called judgments.^[+]
<note name="+">
Thanks, Per Martin-Löf (1942-).
</note>
</question>
<answer>
What is the point of a judgment?
</answer>
</dialog>

<comment>
The concept of judgment occurs here.
Laws are about the first form of judgment,
but the concept of judgment is more formal than Laws.
</comment>

<comment topic="didactics">
<title>The Didactics of familiar concept</title>

More formal concept should be introduced
after the introduction of the equivalent more familiar concept.
(Explain judgment as Laws in English is more familiar
than direct introduction of formal judgment.)

"The Law of Tick Marks" is an instance of the first form of judgment.
(Introduce instance first, then introduce class.)
</comment>

<dialog>
<question>
A judgment is an attitude that a person takes towards expressions.
When we come to know something, we are making a judgment.

What can be judged about Atom and 'courgette?
</question>
<answer>
'courgette is an Atom.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
A form of judgment is an observation with blank spaces in it, such as
  ___ is a ___.
</question>
<answer>
Are there other forms of judgment?
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Another form of "judgment" is "judgement."
</question>
<answer>
Very funny.
</answer>
</dialog>

<comment>
Another form of "judgment" is "the same" judgement.
But when read it out, the this explanation
can also be understood as the about question.

This is funny because of the joy of debugging the ambiguity.
</comment>

<dialog>
<question>
Is
  'ratatouille
the same
  Atom
as
  'ratatouille?
</question>
<answer>
Yes.

They are the same Atom because both have the same letters after the tick mark.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Is
  'ratatouille
the same
  Atom
as
  'baguette?
</question>
<answer>
No.

They have different letters after the tick mark.
</answer>
</dialog>

<comment topic="didactics">
When teaching, use sentences with consistent pattern.
Repeat the pattern, student will find it out.
</comment>

<comment>
The aim of the above frames is to explain the following commandment.
</comment>

<card kind="commandment">
<title>The Commandment of Tick Marks</title>
Two expressions are the same Atom if their values are tick marks
followed by identical letters and hyphens.
</card>

<dialog>
<question>
The second form of judgment is that
  ____ is the same ____ as ____.
</question>
<answer>
So
  'citron is the same Atom as 'citron
is a judgment.
</answer>
</dialog>

<comment>
From the question "Is 'citron the same Atom as 'citron",
to the question "Is ('citron is the same Atom as 'citron) a judgment",
the abstraction goes one level higher.

One level of quotation occurred,
and this kind of quotation is represented in the frame by indentation.
</comment>

<dialog>
<question>
It is a judgment,
and we have reason to believe it.

Is
  'pomme is the same Atom as 'orange
a judgment?
</question>
<answer>
It is a judgment,
but we have no reason to believe it.
After all, one should not compare apples and oranges.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Is it obvious that
  (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)^[+]
is a
  (Pair Atom Atom)?
<note name="+">
When ready, see page 62 for "typing" instructions.
</note>
</question>
<answer>
No, it isn't.

What does it mean to be a
  (Pair Atom Atom)?
</answer>
</dialog>

<comment>
What not obvious should be further explained.

We want to ask the question "Is (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette) a (Pair Atom Atom)?",
but we have not explained the meaning of Pair,
thus we ask "Is it obvious that ...",
and give reason to explain the meaning of Pair.
</comment>

<dialog>
<question>
To be a
  (Pair Atom Atom)
is to be a pair whose car is an Atom, like 'ratatouille,
and whose cdr is also an Atom, like 'baguette.
</question>
<answer>
The names cons, car, and cdr seem familiar.
What do they mean again?
And what do they have to do with pairs?
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
A pair begins with cons^[+]
and ends with two more parts,
call its car and its cdr.
<note name="+">
In Lisp, cons is used to make lists longer.
Here, cons only constructs pairs.
</note>
</question>
<answer>
Okay. That means that
  (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
is a
  (Pair Atom Atom)
because (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
is a pair whose car is an Atom,
and whose cdr is also an Atom.

Is cons a Pair, then?
</answer>
</dialog>

<comment>
The question in the above answer might be feedback from a student.
Feedback is always important in any system.
</comment>

<dialog>
<question>
Neither cons nor Pair alone is even an expression.
Both require two arguments.^[+]

Is
  (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
the same
  (Pair Atom Atom)
as
  (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)?
<note name="+">
In Lisp, cons is a procedure and has meaning on its own,
but forms such as cond or lambda are meaningless if they appear alone.
</note>
</question>
<answer>
What does it mean for two expressions to be the same
  (Pair Atom Atom)?
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
It means that both cars are the same Atom
and that both cdrs are the same Atom.
</question>
<answer>
Then
  (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
is indeed the same
  (Pair Atom Atom)
as
  (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette).
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Is
  (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
the same
  (Pair Atom Atom)
as
  (cons 'baguette 'baguette)?
</question>
<answer>
The car of
  (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
is 'ratatouille, while the car of
  (cons 'baguette 'baguette)
is 'baguette.

So we have no reason to believe that
they are the same (Pair Atom Atom).
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
How can
  (cdr
    (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette))
be described?
</question>
<answer>
It is an
  Atom.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
Expressions that describe other expressions,
such as Atom, are called types.

Is (Pair Atom Atom)^[+] a type?
<note name="+">
When a name, such as Pair or Atom, refers to a type,
it starts with an upper-case letter.
</note>
</question>
<answer>
Yes, because it describes pairs where the car and cdr are both Atoms.
</answer>
</dialog>

<dialog>
<question>
The third form of judgment is
  ___ is a type.
</question>
<answer>
This means that both
  Atom is a type
and
  (Pair Atom Atom) is a type
are judgments.
</answer>
</dialog>

<card kind="law">
<title>The Law of Atom</title>
Atom is a type.
