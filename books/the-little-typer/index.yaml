- Dialog:
    teacher: Welcome back!
    student: It's good to be here!

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Let's dust off and update some of our old toys
      for a new language called Pie.

      Is it obvious that this is an Atom?
        'atom
    student: |
      Not at all. What does Atom mean?

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      To be an Atom is to be an atom.^[+]
    teacher_notes:
      +: |
        In Lisp, atoms are symbols, numbers, and many other things.
        Here, atoms are only symbols.
    student: |
      Then 'atom is an Atom because 'atom is an atom.

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is it obvious that this is an Atom?
        'ratatouille
    student: |
      Yes, because 'ratatouille is also an atom.

      But what does it precisely mean to be an atom?

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Atoms are built from a tick mark
      directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens.^[+]
    teacher_notes:
      +: In Pie, only atoms use the tick mark.
    student: |
      So, is it obvious that
        'is-it-obvious-that-this-is-an-atom
      is an Atom?

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Certainly, because atoms can contain hyphens.

      What about
        '---
      and
        ---
      and
        '
      Are they atoms?
    student: |
      Hum...
        '---
      is an atom because hyphens can appear anywhere in an atom;
        ---
      is not an atom because it's missing the tick mark; and
        '
      is not an atom because it is neither followed by a letter nor by a hyphen.

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is 'Atom an Atom?
    student: |
      Yes, even 'Atom is an Atom, because it is a tick mark followed by one or more letters or hyphens.

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is 'atOm an Atom?
    student: |
      No, because atoms can contain only letters and hyphens,
      as mentioned in frame 5,
      and the character 0 is not a letter.
      It is the digit zero.

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is 'cœurs-d-artichauts an Atom?
    student: |
      Yes, because œ is a letter.

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is 'ἄτομον an Atom?
    student: |
      That's Greek to me!

      But Greek letters are letters, so it must also be an Atom.

- Comment: |
    The aim of the above frames is to explain the following law.

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is 'ἄτομον an Atom?
    student: |
      That's Greek to me!

      But Greek letters are letters, so it must also be an Atom.

    content: A tick mark directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens is an Atom.

    The Didactics of forwarding engaging examples

    To introduce a new concept, first give many engaging examples.

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Sentences such as
        'ratatouille is an Atom
      and
        'cœurs-d-artichauts is an Atom
      are called judgments.^[+]
    teacher_notes:
      +: Thanks, Per Martin-Löf (1942-).
    student:
      What is the point of a judgment?

- Comment: |
    The concept of judgment occurs here.
    Laws are about the first form of judgment,
    but the concept of judgment is more formal than Laws.

- Comment: |
    The Didactics of familiar concept

    More formal concept should be introduced
    after the introduction of the equivalent more familiar concept.
    (Explain judgment as Laws in English is more familiar
    than direct introduction of formal judgment.)

    "The Law of Tick Marks" is an instance of the first form of judgment.
    (Introduce instance first, then introduce class.)

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      A judgment is an attitude that a person takes towards expressions.
      When we come to know something, we are making a judgment.

      What can be judged about Atom and 'courgette?

    student: |
      'courgette is an Atom.



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      A form of judgment is an observation with blank spaces in it, such as
        ___ is a ___.

    student: |
      Are there other forms of judgment?



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Another form of "judgment" is "judgement."

    student: |
      Very funny.



- Comment: |
    Another form of "judgment" is "the same" judgement.

    This is funny because of the joy of debugging ambiguity.


- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is
        'ratatouille
      the same
        Atom
      as
        'ratatouille?

    student: |
      Yes.

      They are the same Atom because both have the same letters after the tick mark.



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is
        'ratatouille
      the same
        Atom
      as
        'baguette?

    student: |
      No.

      They have different letters after the tick mark.



- Comment: |
    When teaching, use sentences with consistent pattern.
    Repeat the pattern, student will find it out.


- Comment: |
    The aim of the above frames is to explain the following commandment.


- card:
    title: The Commandment of Tick Marks
    content: |
      Two expressions are the same Atom if their values are tick marks
      followed by identical letters and hyphens.


- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      The second form of judgment is that
        ____ is the same ____ as ____.

    student: |
      So
        'citron is the same Atom as 'citron
      is a judgment.



- Comment: |
    From the question (Is 'citron the same Atom as 'citron),
    to the question (Is ('citron is the same Atom as 'citron) a judgment)
    the abstraction goes one level higher.

    One level of quotation occurred,
    and this kind of quotation is represented in the frame by indentation.


- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      It is a judgment,
      and we have reason to believe it.

      Is
        'pomme is the same Atom as 'orange
      a judgment?

    student: |
      It is a judgment,
      but we have no reason to believe it.
      After all, one should not compare apples and oranges.



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is it obvious that
        (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)^[+]
      is a
        (Pair Atom Atom)?
    teacher_notes:
      +: When ready, see page 62 for "typing" instructions.

    student: |
      No, it isn't.

      What does it mean to be a
        (Pair Atom Atom)?



- Comment: |
    What not obvious should be further explained.

    We want to ask the question "Is (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette) a (Pair Atom Atom)?",
    but we have not explained the meaning of Pair,
    thus we ask "Is it obvious that ...",
    and give reason to explain the meaning of Pair.


- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      To be a
        (Pair Atom Atom)
      is to be a pair whose car is an Atom, like 'ratatouille,
      and whose cdr is also an Atom, like 'baguette.

    student: |
      The names cons, car, and cdr seem familiar.
      What do they mean again?
      And what do they have to do with pairs?



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      A pair begins with cons^[+]
      and ends with two more parts,
      call its car and its cdr.
    teacher_notes:
      +: |
        In Lisp, cons is used to make lists longer.
        Here, cons only constructs pairs.


    student: |
      Okay. That means that
        (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
      is a
        (Pair Atom Atom)
      because (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
      is a pair whose car is an Atom,
      and whose cdr is also an Atom.

      Is cons a Pair, then?



- Comment: |
    The question in the above answer might be feedback from a student.
    Feedback is always important in any system.


- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Neither cons nor Pair alone is even an expression.
      Both require two arguments.^[+]

      Is
        (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
      the same
        (Pair Atom Atom)
      as
        (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)?
    teacher_notes:
      +: |
        In Lisp, cons is a procedure and has meaning on its own,
        but forms such as cond or lambda are meaningless if they appear alone.


    student: |
      What does it mean for two expressions to be the same
        (Pair Atom Atom)?



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      It means that both cars are the same Atom
      and that both cdrs are the same Atom.

    student: |
      Then
        (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
      is indeed the same
        (Pair Atom Atom)
      as
        (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette).



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is
        (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
      the same
        (Pair Atom Atom)
      as
        (cons 'baguette 'baguette)?

    student: |
      The car of
        (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette)
      is 'ratatouille, while the car of
        (cons 'baguette 'baguette)
      is 'baguette.

      So we have no reason to believe that
      they are the same (Pair Atom Atom).



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      How can
        (cdr
          (cons 'ratatouille 'baguette))
      be described?

    student: |
      It is an
        Atom.



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Expressions that describe other expressions,
      such as Atom, are called types.

      Is (Pair Atom Atom)^[+] a type?
    teacher_notes:
      +: |
        When a name, such as Pair or Atom, refers to a type,
        it starts with an upper-case letter.

    student: |
      Yes, because it describes pairs where the car and cdr are both Atoms.



- Comment: |
    Expressions that describe other expressions are called types.

    This definition of type is very simple,
    with a leading question, it is even more natural.


- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      The third form of judgment is
        ___ is a type.

    student: |
      This means that both
        Atom is a type
      and
        (Pair Atom Atom) is a type
      are judgments.



- card:
    title: The Law of Atom
    content: Atom is a type.

- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Is
        'courgette is a type
      a judgment?

    student: |
      It is a judgment,
      but we have no reason to believe it
      because 'courgette doesn't describe other expressions.



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      Are Atom and Atom the same type?

    student: |
      Presumably.
      They certainly look like they should be.



- Dialog:
    teacher: |
      The fourth and final form of judgment is
        ___ and ___ are the same type.

    student: |
      Ah, so
        Atom and Atom are the same type
      is a judgment, and we have reason to believe it.


- card:
    title: The Four Forms of Judgment
    content: |
      (1)                   ___ is a ___.
      (2)     ___ is the same ___ as ___.
      (3)                  ___ is a type.
      (4)  ___ and ___ are the same type.

- Comment: |
    The (3) seems like special (1),
    and the (4) seems like special (2).
