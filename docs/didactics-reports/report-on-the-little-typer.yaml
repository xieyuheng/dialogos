  title: Guidelines for The Reader

  content: |
    Do not rush through this book.
    Read carefully, including the frame notes;
    valuable hints are scattered throughout the text.
    Read every chapter.
    Remember to take breaks so each chapter can sink in.
    Read systematically.
    If you do not fully understand one chapter,
    you will understand the next one even less.
    The questions are ordered by increasing difficulty;
    later questions rely on comfort gained earlier in the book.

    *Guess!* This book is based on intuition,
    and yours is as good as anyone's.
    Also, if you can, experiment with the examples while you read.

    From time to time, we show computation steps in a chart.
    Stop and work through each chart, even the long ones,
    and convince yourself *that* each step makes sense
    by understanding *why* it makes sense.

    The **Laws** and **Commandments** summarize the meanings of expressions in Pie.
    Laws describe which expressions are meaningful,
    and Commandments describe which expressions are the same as others.
    For a Commandment to apply, it is assumed that the corresponding Laws are satisfied.

    - The "Laws describe which expressions are meaningful"
      is the first form of judgments.
      The "Commandments describe which expressions are the same as others"
      is the second form of judgments.

    Food appears in some examples for two reasons.
    First, food is easier to visualize than abstract symbols.
    We hope the food imagery helps you to better understand the examples and concepts.
    Second, we want to provide a little distraction.
    Expanding your mind can be tiring;
    these snacks should help you get through the afternoon.
    As such, we hope that thinking about food will lead you to take some breaks and relax.

    You are now ready to start.
    Good luck! We hope you enjoy the book.

    - The book is not as systematic as textbook,
      but you need to "read systematically",
      to organize the frames into your own system,
      "your intuition is as good as anyone's."
      - The lack of explicit system,
        helps the reader to read the frames actively.

    - Learning in this way is viewed as "expanding your mind".

  - title: 1. The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same

    frames:

    - question: |
        Welcome back!

      answer: |
        It's good to be here!

    - question: |
        Let's dust off and update some of our old toys
        for a new language called Pie.

        Is it obvious that this is an Atom?
          'atom

      answer: |
        Not at all. What does Atom mean?

    - question: |
        To be an Atom is to be an atom.^[+]

      question_note: |
        [+] In Lisp, atoms are symbols, numbers,
        and many other things.
        Here, atoms are only symbols.

      answer: |
        Then 'atom is an Atom because 'atom is an atom.

    - question: |
        Is it obvious that this is an Atom?
          'ratatouille

      answer: |
        Yes, because 'ratatouille is also an atom.

        But what does it precisely mean to be an atom?

    - question: |
        Atoms are built from a tick mark
        directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens.^[+]

      answer: |
        Yes, because 'ratatouille is also an atom.

        But what does it precisely mean to be an atom?

    - question: |
        Atoms are built from a tick mark
        directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens.^[+]

      question_note: |
        [+] In Pie, only atoms use the tick mark.

      answer: |
        So, is it obvious that
          'is-it-obvious-that-this-is-an-atom
        is an Atom?

    - question: |
        Certainly, because atoms can contain hyphens.

        What about
          '---
        and
          ---
        and
          '
        Are they atoms?

      answer: |
        Hum...
          '---
        is an atom because hyphens can appear anywhere in an atom;
          ---
        is not an atom because it's missing the tick mark; and
          '
        is not an atom because it is neither followed by a letter nor by a hyphen.

    - question: |
        Is 'Atom an Atom?

      answer: |
        Yes, even 'Atom is an Atom, because it is a tick mark followed by one or more letters or hyphens.

    - question: |
        Is 'atOm an Atom?

      answer: |
        No, because atoms can contain only letters and hyphens,
        as mentioned in frame 5,
        and the character 0 is not a letter.
        It is the digit zero.

    - question: |
        Is 'cœurs-d-artichauts an Atom?

      answer: |
        Yes, because œ is a letter.

    - question: |
        Is 'ἄτομον an Atom?

      answer: |
        That's Greek to me!

        But Greek letters are letters, so it must also be an Atom.

    - comment: |
        - The aim of the above frames is to explain the following law.

        - **The Didactics of forwarding engaging examples**
          To introduce a new concept, first give many engaging examples.

    - kind: law
      title: The Law of Tick Marks
      content:
        A tick mark directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens is an Atom.

    - comment: |
        - The concept of judgment occurs next.
          Laws are about the first form of judgment,
          but the concept of judgment is more formal than Laws.

        - **The Didactics of familiar concept**
          More formal concept should be introduced
          after the introduction of the equivalent more familiar concept.
          (Explain judgment as Laws in English is more familiar
          than direct introduction of formal judgment.)

        - "The Law of Tick Marks" is an instance of the first form of judgment.
          (Introduce instance first, then introduce class.)

    - question: |
        Sentences such as
          'ratatouille is an Atom
        and
          'cœurs-d-artichauts is an Atom
        are called judgments.^[+]

      question_note: |
        [+] Thanks, Per Martin-Löf (1942-).

        What is the point of a judgment?
