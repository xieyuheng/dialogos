# Report on The Little Typer

## Guidelines for The Reader

Do not rush through this book.
Read carefully, including the frame notes;
valuable hints are scattered throughout the text.
Read every chapter.
Remember to take breaks so each chapter can sink in.
Read systematically.
If you do not fully understand one chapter,
you will understand the next one even less.
The questions are ordered by increasing difficulty;
later questions rely on comfort gained earlier in the book.

*Guess!* This book is based on intuition,
and yours is as good as anyone's.
Also, if you can, experiment with the examples while you read.

From time to time, we show computation steps in a chart.
Stop and work through each chart, even the long ones,
and convince yourself *that* each step makes sense
by understanding *why* it makes sense.

The **Laws** and **Commandments** summarize the meanings of expressions in Pie.
Laws describe which expressions are meaningful,
and Commandments describe which expressions are the same as others.
For a Commandment to apply, it is assumed that the corresponding Laws are satisfied.

- The "Laws describe which expressions are meaningful"
  is the first form of judgments.
  The "Commandments describe which expressions are the same as others"
  is the second form of judgments.

Food appears in some examples for two reasons.
First, food is easier to visualize than abstract symbols.
We hope the food imagery helps you to better understand the examples and concepts.
Second, we want to provide a little distraction.
Expanding your mind can be tiring;
these snacks should help you get through the afternoon.
As such, we hope that thinking about food will lead you to take some breaks and relax.

You are now ready to start.
Good luck! We hope you enjoy the book.

- The book is not as systematic as textbook,
  but you need to "read systematically",
  to organize the frames into your own system,
  "your intuition is as good as anyone's."
  - The lack of explicit system,
    helps the reader to read the frames actively.

- Learning in this way is viewed as "expanding your mind".
