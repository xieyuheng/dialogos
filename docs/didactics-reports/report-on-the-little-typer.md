# Report on The Little Typer

## Guidelines for The Reader

Do not rush through this book.
Read carefully, including the frame notes;
valuable hints are scattered throughout the text.
Read every chapter.
Remember to take breaks so each chapter can sink in.
Read systematically.
If you do not fully understand one chapter,
you will understand the next one even less.
The questions are ordered by increasing difficulty;
later questions rely on comfort gained earlier in the book.

*Guess!* This book is based on intuition,
and yours is as good as anyone's.
Also, if you can, experiment with the examples while you read.

From time to time, we show computation steps in a chart.
Stop and work through each chart, even the long ones,
and convince yourself *that* each step makes sense
by understanding *why* it makes sense.

The **Laws** and **Commandments** summarize the meanings of expressions in Pie.
Laws describe which expressions are meaningful,
and Commandments describe which expressions are the same as others.
For a Commandment to apply, it is assumed that the corresponding Laws are satisfied.

- The "Laws describe which expressions are meaningful"
  is the first form of judgments.
  The "Commandments describe which expressions are the same as others"
  is the second form of judgments.

Food appears in some examples for two reasons.
First, food is easier to visualize than abstract symbols.
We hope the food imagery helps you to better understand the examples and concepts.
Second, we want to provide a little distraction.
Expanding your mind can be tiring;
these snacks should help you get through the afternoon.
As such, we hope that thinking about food will lead you to take some breaks and relax.

You are now ready to start.
Good luck! We hope you enjoy the book.

- The book is not as systematic as textbook,
  but you need to "read systematically",
  to organize the frames into your own system,
  "your intuition is as good as anyone's."
  - The lack of explicit system,
    helps the reader to read the frames actively.

- Learning in this way is viewed as "expanding your mind".

<question>
Let's dust off and update some of our old toys
for a new language called Pie.

Is it obvious that this is an Atom?
  'atom
</question>
<answer>
Not at all. What does Atom mean?
</answer>
</frame>

<frame>
<question>
To be an Atom is to be an atom.^[+]
</question>
<note>
[+] In Lisp, atoms are symbols, numbers, and many other things.
Here, atoms are only symbols.
</note>
<answer>
Then 'atom is an Atom because 'atom is an atom.
</answer>
</frame>

<frame>
<question>
Is it obvious that this is an Atom?
  'ratatouille
</question>
<answer>
Yes, because 'ratatouille is also an atom.

But what does it precisely mean to be an atom?
</answer>
</frame>

</TODO>

- The aim of the above frames is to explain the following law.

- **The Didactics of forwarding engaging examples**
  To introduce a new concept, first give many engaging examples.

<law>
<title>The Law of Tick Marks</title>
A tick mark directly followed by one or more letters and hyphens is an Atom.
</law>

- The concept of judgment occurs next.
  Laws are about the first form of judgment,
  but the concept of judgment is more formal than Laws.

- **The Didactics of familiar concept**
  More formal concept should be introduced
  after the introduction of the equivalent more familiar concept.
  (Explain judgment as Laws in English is more familiar
  than direct introduction of formal judgment.)

- "The Law of Tick Marks" is an instance of the first form of judgment.
  (Introduce instance first, then introduce class.)

<frame>
<question>
Sentences such as
  'ratatouille is an Atom
and
  'cœurs-d-artichauts is an Atom
are called judgments.^[+]
<note>
[+] Thanks, Per Martin-Löf (1942-).
</note>
</question>
<answer>
What is the point of a judgment?
</answer>
</frame>

</TODO>

- The aim of the above frames is to explain the following commandment.

<commandment>
<title>The Commandment of Tick Marks</title>
Two expressions are the same Atom if their values are tick marks
followed by identical letters and hyphens.
</commandment>

<frame>
<question>
The second form of judgment is that
  ____ is the same ____ as ____.
</question>
<answer>
So
  'citron is the same Atom as 'citron
is a judgment.
</answer>
</frame>

- From question "Is 'citron the same Atom as 'citron",
  to "Is ('citron is the same Atom as 'citron) a judgment",
  the abstraction goes one level higher.

  One level of quotation occurred,
  and this kind of quotation is represented in the frame by indentation.

<frame>
<question>
It is a judgment, and we have reason to believe it.

Is
  'pomme is the same Atom as 'orange
a judgment?
</question>
<answer>
